# Satellite Image Analysis with Computer Vision and Deep Learning

This project demonstrates how to use PyTorch for classifying satellite images. The example script loads an image, applies necessary transformations, and then uses a pre-trained model to predict the class of the image.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- torchvision
